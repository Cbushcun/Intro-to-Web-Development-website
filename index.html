	<h2>Course Expectations</h2>
	<p>From this course, I am expecting to learn how to create clean and appealing webpages.
	Some ways I expect to do that are learning the backend operations of web development in order
	to optimize the user's browsing experience. Keeping file sizes as small as possible can maximize
	the user-end viewing experience by keeping things moving quick. Another way I can achieve an appealing
	design is visuals. Learning how to create an aesthetic website that is not a strain on the eyes will allow
	users to visit my sites for longer periods of time and enjoy interacting with it. The final way that I 
	expect to develop from this class, is learning how to add many different pages to my website in order
	to keep my pages short and clean and allow me to spread my information around so that it is less overwhelming
	and users can easily find their way to the sections they are looking for.</p>
