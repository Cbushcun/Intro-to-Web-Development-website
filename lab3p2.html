		<p>From this class I have learned various things that go into the web building process.
		 One of the important things I have learned was how to choose fonts to improve readability.
		 It is important to use readable fonts because many users are going to be visiting your site. 
		 Having a clean font with slight spacing in between the texts can allow many users to have an 
		 easier time reading all of the content on your webpage. </p>
		
		<p>Another thing I have learned that plays into the last topic is the units that are used to set
		 sizing of elements in the web page. It is best to use units such as <i>em</i> or <i>%</i> due to the ability
		 of those measurements scaling with the size of the screen/window rather than using absolute pixel measurements
		 in order to position things on the webpage. This allows for more variation in your page and prevents any issues
		 that you may run into due to using absolute pixel sizing.</p>
		
		<p>The final things I have learned is readability. This encapsulates the topics previously described but considers
		 the whole page and how it is laid out. It is also important to think about color scheme and positioning of things
		 on the website. You do not want to have drastic color differences such as pure white on a pure black background when
		 building a dark theme website. It strains the eyes and lowers the time an individual can look at the screen. You must
		 also be mindful of the layout of your website so that it is easy to read and there are not stray or intrusive elements that
		 distract the viewer or lessens their experience by being there. Too much information on one page is not good so spreading out
		 information when possible without adding too much navigation is a balance that must be found.</p>
